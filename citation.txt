As this code relies on both Skirt and Cloudy, both codes should be referenced as well.
-For Skirt, it was used its version 9, described in Camps & Baes (2020):
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26C....3100381C/abstract
-For Cloudy, it was used its version 17.03, described in Ferland et al. (2017):
