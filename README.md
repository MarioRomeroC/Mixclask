Mixing cloudy and skirt

This code combine cloudy (https://gitlab.nublado.org/cloudy/cloudy/-/wikis/home) and skirt (https://skirt.ugent.be/root/_landing.html) to predict spectra and gas properties in astrophysical contexts (galaxies, HII regions...). This code assumes that you have installed both codes.
You must also have python3 installed with flatten-dict module (if not, write 'pip3 install flatten-dict' in terminal)


(WORK IN PROGRESS...)
