Here you find ISRFs generated for Mulchem and MMA models.
Each file contains a SED between 0.01 to 300 microns at some radius R and height z, in kpc. R and z are given in the name of the file.
Inside the file, you have the mean and median ISRF of 18 and 7 iterations (Mulchem and MMA models, respectively), alonside its variance and percentiles 16 and 84.
